## Med Cabinet
#### Heroku application that uses NLP and KNN to provide Cannabis strain recommendations based on what the user specifies.

This application recieves user input from either a drop down menu or via a text box. The KNN model then returns the 5 most similar cannabis strains from the training data and displays the strain profiles with:
- Strain name
- Strain type
- Overall rating
- Effects
- Flavor
- Short Description

The original training data used for this KNN model can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/cannabis-strains).

The notebook used to build the KNN model can be [here](notebooks/Med_Cabinet_Final.ipynb).
